Project Idea:
This is a webpage for users to enter a dish, then to press the search button and it will return to the recipe page.
On the recipe page there will be additional information regarding the nutrition facts of recipe.

User Story
As an avid home cook, I want to use the Recipe Finder website to discover new and exciting recipes, so that I can expand my culinary skills and create delicious meals for myself and my loved ones.

Acceptance criteria
Given I am on the Recipe Finder homepage
When I enter a keyword (e.g., "chicken") into the search bar and click "Search‚Äù.
Then I should see a list of recipes containing the keyword in the title or description
And each result should display a high-quality image, brief description, and nutritional information about the dish.

When I search for a dish and its information gets successfully displayed. 

Then dish title/name is saved to local storage and displayed in the recipe search history area.
